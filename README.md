## 💡 The Problem
For the **Neurodivergent (ND)** community (Autism, ADHD, CPTSD), social interaction is a minefield. We often miss subtext, leading to burnout and victimization.
* "Is this person gaslighting me?"
* "Why do I feel guilty after this conversation?"
* "What is the hidden power dynamic?"

## 🛠️ The Solution
**Soul Scanner** is a forensic text analyst powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**. It acts as a "Cognitive Prosthesis" to protect your peace.

### Key Features (The "Three-Mind" Architecture)
1.  **🎭 Mask X-Ray:** Instantly detects psychological manipulation (Gaslighting, Triangulation, Projection).
2.  **⚖️ Power Dynamics:** Calculates the "DPI" (Dynamic Power Index) to show who holds the leverage.
3.  **🛡️ Grey Rock Defense:** Generates safe, low-energy responses to de-escalate conflict.
